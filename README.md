# Dockerize Your Dev

Starting point for running your "available online" company or personal development environment on most modern Linux VMs.

## Roadmap

* Portainer (gui)
* ELK Stack (logging)
* Grafana/Prometheus (monitoring)
* Gitea (git)
* Sentry (errors)
* Mattermost (chat)
* NGINX (reverse proxy)
* LetsEncrypt (safety)
* Code Server (code editor)

That is my goal anyways, it will all be docker-compose so it could be split up however between servers or shoved onto one.
